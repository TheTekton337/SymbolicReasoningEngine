# Contributing to SymbolicReasoningEngine

We welcome contributions to the SymbolicReasoningEngine project! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project. Whether you're reporting a bug, suggesting an enhancement, or adding a new feature, your support is appreciated.

## Getting Started

Before you begin:
- Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup).
- Familiarize yourself with the [project structure](https://github.com/TheTekton337/SymbolicReasoningEngine) and its documentation.
- Check the [issues](https://github.com/TheTekton337/SymbolicReasoningEngine/issues) for already reported bugs or feature requests to avoid duplicates.
- For substantial changes, it's always a good idea to discuss your ideas with the community through an issue before you start working on it.

## Making Changes

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2. **Clone your fork** locally on your machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TheTekton337/SymbolicReasoningEngine.git
    cd SymbolicReasoningEngine
    ```
3. **Create a new branch** for your changes. We use the `develop` branch for ongoing development, so base your work on that branch.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b my-feature develop
    ```
4. **Make your changes**. Write clear, commented, and readable code. Make sure your changes are as concise as possible.
5. **Commit your changes**. Use meaningful commit messages that accurately describe your modifications.
    ```bash
    git commit -am 'Add some feature'
    ```
6. **Push your changes** to your fork on GitHub.
    ```bash
    git push origin my-feature
    ```
7. **Create a pull request** from your `my-feature` branch to the `develop` branch of the original SymbolicReasoningEngine repository.

## Creating a Pull Request

When you're ready to contribute your changes back to the main project:
1. Navigate to the repository you forked on GitHub.
2. Click the "Pull request" button.
3. Select `develop` as the base branch, and your `my-feature` branch as the compare branch.
4. Enter a clear title and description for your pull request.
5. Click "Create pull request."

Once your pull request is submitted, the project maintainers will review your contribution. They may suggest changes or improvements to your pull request before merging it into the project.

## Additional Guidelines

- **Follow the coding conventions** used throughout the project, including indentation, code commenting, and documentation.
- **Add or update tests** as appropriate for your changes. Ensure all tests pass before submitting your pull request.
- **Update the documentation** if you're adding new features or making changes that affect how users interact with the project.
